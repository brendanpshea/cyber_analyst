		\begin{itemize}
			\item Security architecture provides the framework for implementing protective measures across systems and networks.
			\item \textbf{Security architecture} is defined as the design of systems and processes that protect information assets from unauthorized access or damage.
			\item Effective security architecture aligns with business goals while mitigating risks through defense-in-depth strategies.
			\item Security operations depend on well-designed architecture to identify, respond to, and recover from security incidents.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{alertblock}{Key Concept}
			Security architecture is not just about technologyâ€”it's about creating a cohesive strategy that includes people, processes, and technology working together.

		\frametitle{13. Container Security: Protecting Microservices in Production}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Containers} are lightweight, portable environments that package code and dependencies for consistent operation across environments.
			\item Container security differs from VM security because containers share the host OS kernel, creating a different isolation model.
			\item Security strategies include scanning container images for vulnerabilities, using minimal base images, and implementing runtime protection.
			\item Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes require additional security considerations for pod communication and secrets management.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{example}{Container Security Best Practices}
			\scriptsize
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Use signed and verified container images from trusted repositories
				\item Implement network policies to control pod-to-pod communications
				\item Apply the principle of least privilege to container runtime permissions

		\frametitle{24. Federation: Managing Identity Across Organizational Boundaries}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Federation} is a mechanism that enables separate organizations to share identity information securely across trust boundaries.
			\item Federated identity allows users to use credentials from one domain to access resources in another domain without creating multiple accounts.
			\item Federation relies on established trust relationships between identity providers and service providers.
			\item Implementation typically uses standards like SAML, WS-Federation, or OAuth/OpenID Connect to securely exchange identity assertions.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{example}{Federation in Action}
			A university professor can use their university credentials (identity provider) to access an external research database (service provider) without creating a separate account. The research database trusts the university to properly authenticate the professor, while the university maintains control over the professor's authentication methods and access rights.

		\frametitle{21. Identity: The New Security Perimeter}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Identity} has become the primary security boundary in modern environments where traditional network perimeters are dissolving.
			\item Identity and access management (IAM) systems provide the foundation for authenticating users and authorizing access to resources.
			\item Identity-focused security requires continuous validation of user identity, device health, and contextual risk factors.
			\item Identity systems must be protected as critical infrastructure since compromise can lead to widespread access across environments.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{alertblock}{Identity as the Attack Vector}
			\scriptsize
			Compromised credentials are involved in over 80\% of data breaches, making identity protection a critical security priority. Attack techniques like password spraying, credential stuffing, and phishing specifically target this new perimeter.

		\frametitle{22. Multifactor Authentication: Why Passwords Alone Are Not Enough}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Multifactor Authentication (MFA)} requires two or more verification factors: something you know, something you have, or something you are.
			\item MFA significantly reduces the risk of account compromise, even when passwords are leaked or stolen.
			\item Authentication factors vary in security strength, with biometrics and hardware tokens generally offering stronger protection than SMS codes.
			\item Proper MFA implementation requires balancing security requirements with user experience considerations.
		\end{itemize}

		\frametitle{23. Single Sign-On: Balancing Security and User Experience}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Single Sign-On (SSO)} allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications without additional login prompts.
			\item SSO improves security by reducing password fatigue, enabling centralized authentication management, and streamlining access revocation.
			\item SSO implementations typically use protocols like SAML, OAuth, or OpenID Connect to securely share authentication information.
			\item While SSO creates a single point of entry, it should be strengthened with MFA and continuous monitoring to mitigate this risk.
